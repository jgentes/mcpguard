# Installation

MCP Guard can be installed in two ways:
1. **VS Code Extension** (Recommended) - Visual interface for managing MCP security
2. **npx Command** - Quick setup for Cursor, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system

## VS Code Extension (Recommended)

The VS Code extension provides a visual interface for managing your MCP servers and their security settings.

<Steps>

### Install the Extension

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "MCP Guard"
4. Click **Install**

Or install directly from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=forgedapps.mcpguard).

### Open MCP Guard

Click the **shield icon** 🛡️ in the activity bar (left sidebar) to open the MCP Guard panel.

### Auto-Discovery

Your MCP servers are automatically imported from:
- Claude Code configuration
- Cursor configuration  
- GitHub Copilot configuration

### Enable Protection

Toggle protection **on** for any MCP you want to secure. Configure network, file system, and resource settings as needed.

</Steps>

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Access">
  Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "MCP Guard: Open Settings" to open the panel anytime.
</Callout>

## npx Command (Quick Setup)

For users of Cursor, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot, you can set up MCP Guard directly in your IDE configuration.

<Steps>

### Add MCPGuard to Your IDE Config

<Tabs items={['One-Click Install', 'Manual Configuration']}>
  <Tab value="One-Click Install">
    Click the button below to install MCPGuard in Cursor:
    
    [![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=mcpguard&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyIteSIsIm1jcGd1YXJkIl19)
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Manual Configuration">
    Add to your IDE's MCP configuration file:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mcpguard": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "mcpguard"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Configuration file locations:**
    - **Cursor**: `~/.cursor/mcp.jsonc` (or `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\mcp.jsonc` on Windows)
    - **Claude Code**: `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.jsonc` (or `%APPDATA%\Claude Code\User\globalStorage\mcp.jsonc` on Windows)
    - **GitHub Copilot**: `~/.github/copilot/mcp.jsonc` (or `%APPDATA%\GitHub Copilot\mcp.jsonc` on Windows)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Disable Existing MCPs (Recommended)

To maximize efficiency and security, disable any existing MCPs in your IDE configuration.

**Why disable?**
- ⚡ **Efficiency**: Without disabling, your IDE loads all MCP tools into the context window, wasting tokens. MCPGuard only loads tools lazily when you actually use them.
- 🔒 **Security**: Ensures all tool calls route through MCPGuard's secure isolation instead of being called directly.

**How to disable:**
- **Option 1**: Ask your LLM: "Disable all MCPs except mcpguard in my IDE configuration"
- **Option 2**: Manually comment out or remove other MCP entries in your IDE's MCP config file

### Restart Your IDE

Restart your IDE for changes to take effect.

### Done!

MCPGuard automatically:
- Discovers all other MCPs configured in your IDE (even disabled ones)
- Routes all tool calls through secure Worker isolation
- Lazy-loads MCPs when their tools are actually used

</Steps>

## How Transparent Proxy Mode Works

MCPGuard automatically:

1. **Discovers** all MCPs configured in your IDE (Cursor, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot)
2. **Lazy-loads** tool schemas only when tools are actually called (not upfront)
3. **Routes** all tool calls through secure Worker isolation
4. **Auto-loads** MCPs when their tools are first used

**Example:** If you have `github` MCP configured, MCPGuard will:
- When the LLM calls `github::search_repositories`, MCPGuard automatically loads the GitHub MCP schema and executes the call in isolation
- All results are returned transparently - the LLM doesn't need to know about the isolation layer
- Tool schemas are cached after first use for faster subsequent calls
